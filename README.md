# Image Segmentation with OpenCV and Python

This repository contains a Python script that segments an image into multiple parts using the OpenCV library. Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, and this script provides a simple demonstration of how to achieve it using Python.

## Features

- Divides an image into specified number of parts
- Uses OpenCV for image processing
- Beginner-friendly code
- Easy to understand and modify

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `segmentation.py` file.
2. Install the required dependencies (`opencv-python`) using pip: `pip install opencv-python`.
3. Replace `"example.jpg"` in the script with the path to your own image.
4. Run the script: `python segmentation.py`.
5. Enter the number of parts to segment the image into.
6. View the segmented images displayed by the script.

## Example

Input image:

![Input Image](example.jpg)

Segmented image (4 parts):

![Segmented Image](example_segmented.jpg)
